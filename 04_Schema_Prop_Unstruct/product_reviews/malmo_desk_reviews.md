Assembly was a nightmare. Instructions were confusing and hardware was missing.
Quality seems poor for the price point.

Good desk overall. Sturdy construction and nice finish. Assembly took longer than expected
but final product is satisfactory.

Terrible quality! Desk wobbles constantly and drawers don't close properly.
Supplier needs to improve their manufacturing quality control.
